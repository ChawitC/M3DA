In additions to the X3D files provided in accodance to assignment specifications,
The original C4D files for both models and render scenes are also provided.

However, in C4D, the texture paths are not relative paths but are local paths
thus all textures must be manually relinked accordingly on your end 
if you attempt to view these C4D files correctly on your computer.

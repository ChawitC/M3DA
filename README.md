# Points of Deep Understanding
+ (1) Models were made in Maxon Cinema4D
with texture using UV projection method (Coke can)
or texture baking (Sprite bottle & Dr Pepper cup).
+ (2) Models were exported from Maxon Cinema4D's format (.c4d) exported to VRML2.0 (.wrc)
then were coverted to X3D/X3DOM (.x3d) with Instant Reality Transcoders.
Headlights, rotation animation, and camera were hard coded to .x3d after the fact, since compatability from C4D was limited.
+ (3) 3D Renders were done in Maxon Cinema4D using Hardware Renderer, 6 Renders were made.
+ (4) Version control were done with GitHub, with commit to main branch on every significant actions.

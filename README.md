+ Points of Deep Understanding
(1) Models were made in Maxon Cinema4D
with texture using UV projection method (Coke can)
or texture baking (Sprite bottle & Dr Pepper cup)

(2) Models were exported from Maxon Cinema4D's format (.c4d) exported to VRML2.0 (.wrc)
then were coverted to X3D/X3DOM (.x3d) with Instant Reality Transcoders
Headlights, rotation animation, and camera were hard coded to .x3d after the fact, since compatability from C4D was limited

(3) 3D Renders were done in Maxon Cinema4D using Hardware Renderer, 6 Renders were made

(4) Version control were done with GitHub, with commit to main branch on every significant actions
